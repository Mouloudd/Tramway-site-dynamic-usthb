# Tramway-site-dynamic-usthb
By Mouloud Dekar
u need first to modify the connectMysql.php script it is in the mysql folder, with ur mysql database info like the servername ...
then u need to run databaseCreate.php it is in the same folder for the site to be working after that u need to run the pagemain.php and it will be working fine 

IMPORTANT  NOTE : to make admin account u need to add it manually from ur phpmyadmin site by add user to the users table and changing the value of is_admin to 1 .
